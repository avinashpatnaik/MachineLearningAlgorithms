# MachineLearningAlgorithms
Important algorithms like KNN, RandomForest, PCA, KMeans have been implemented from scratch as par of this repository.The goal was to implement predictive analytics algorithms from scratch and to create a Scikit-learn predictive analytics pipeline and perform visualization using Matplotlib.

The python file Predictive_analytics.py contains two parts.

Part 1

Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms<br />

● Supervised Learning algorithms K-NearestNeighbour and Random Forest<br />
● Dimensionality Reduction using PCA<br />
● K-Means Clustering<br />
● Evaluation measures like Accuracy, Recall, Precision, Within cluster Sum of squares<br />

Part 2<br />

● Using the Scikit-learn library, I implemented supervised learning algorithms SVM, LogisticRegression, Decision tree, KNN<br />
● Using the Scikit-learn library I created an ensemble model using the voting classifier of the above-mentioned algorithms.<br />
● Alos created visualization of the confusion matrix for each of the 5 classifiers (including the ensemble) using Matplotlib library.<br />

Confusion Matrices for all the 5 classifiers.<br />

Performed Grid search on hyperparameters of SVM, Decision Tree and KNN and created plots using Matplotlib.<br />
